<H1>Info/Explanation of Bounds</H1>

<P>The QFT translates the known frequency response
(templates) and the</P>

<P>desired performance specifications into required
conditions on the</P>

<P>phase and magnitude of the nominal loop, L0. These
requirements</P>

<P>are referred to as 'bounds.'</P>

<P></P>

<P>Bounds are computed at several frequencies, and are
represented</P>

<P>in the Toolbox by two line styles: a solid line
designates 'stay above'</P>

<P>and a dashed line designates 'stay below.' That is, L0
must stay above</P>

<P>or below its bound at the frequency of that bound.</P>

<P></P>

<P>The bounds are labeled via colors in the upper
left-hand</P>

<P>corner of the figure window in an ascending order by
frequency:</P>

<P>r-red, g-green, b-blue, y-yellow, p-purple, c-cyan.
Colors are </P>

<P>then repeated if there are more than 6 frequencies.</P>
